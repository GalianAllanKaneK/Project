Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War brings you to a world of terror and violence. Four factions will engage in a brutal war for dominance over the planet’s resources. In the first turn-based 4X strategy game set in Warhammer 40,000 you will lead one of four unique factions.

A wise man once said, “In the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium, there is only war.” Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War attempts to create a Civilization-like 4X game against that backdrop, but can’t seem to get away from the fact that war is really all there is to do in the 40K universe. Luckily, it does war pretty well.

Gladius puts you in command of one of four distinct factions: the elite Space Marines, the savage Orks, the creepy Necrons, and the dutiful troopers I’m told I’m supposed to call the Astra Militarum now, even though to me they’ll always be the Imperial Guard. Each has a unique and expansive unit roster that covers a lot of the bases from the tabletop, with everything from Space Marine Dreadnoughts to Necron Doomsday Arks. Almost every unit has a clear, straightforward combat role that can be played off of others to create potent combos.

This game focuses heavily on combat, with the first few rounds requiring the player to create soldiers in order to protect and capture whatever territory they hold. And depending on the chosen faction, their early game can range from relatively easy to downright difficult. Now, this game can be played solo against AI or in multiplayer. Though not as popular as the Dawn Of War series, it is still a decent game to play. Though it does cost about P829.95. BUt it can also be taken for free if you know the proper "procedures". Hopefully, when you buy the game, you will find as much enjoyment as i have.
