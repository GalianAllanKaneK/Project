Phoenix Point has a lot of interesting ideas to contribute to the revitalized turn-based tactics genre but many of them are in need refining and balancing. Things like managing faction relationships and disabling individual enemy body parts are great, and it strikes a good balance of complexity with inventory management. At the same time, it’s woefully underdeveloped in certain areas like mission variety and base-building, and a late-game difficulty spike is so severe and unfair-feeling that it crushed the spirit of this XCOM veteran – twice. Combine that with a general lack of polish and it leaves Phoenix Point in a state that still feels very experimental and unrefined – but it’s an interesting experiment, to be sure. -IGN

Phoenix Point is the acclaimed strategy game from the creator of X-COM, now with Steam Workshop support!

The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield.

Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy.- STEAM

Phoenix Point is an incredibly deep game that feels like a true evolution of the X-COM formula. It has some rough edges, a clunky inventory interface, a few janky animations, and some bugs that definitely made it clear that Phoenix Point isn’t as polished as it could be. Thankfully, most of the bugs I encountered were fixed while I was reviewing the game.

Phoenix Point Behemoth Edition is huge, however. To the degree that I could easily make this review three to four times longer if I wanted. It’s a deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying game that has yet to grow even a little stale for me. The combat is a step up compared to almost any other tactics game out there, and it entwines with the strategical layer beautifully.

Vehicles are one of many tools at your disposal
The sheer variety of playstyles and its sandbox nature to combating the alien threat is glorious, and it’s largely due to the fact that the tech in Phoenix Point expands your options, rather than strictly upgrading what you have. You aren’t going from dinky bullets to lasers and then plasma. Instead, you get grenade launchers, mutant war beasts, and shoulder-mounted weapons to add to your armory rather than replace what’s already there.

The incredibly detailed combat, deep strategic layer, living world, and immense variety didn’t just fill the void in my heart left by the absence of X-COM 3, it replaced it entirely.-Gideons Gaming.

Its currently priced at P549.95 on steam. If you enjoy XCOM then this is a game that can help scratch that itch while also being its own game, and not just a copy.
