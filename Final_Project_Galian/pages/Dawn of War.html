Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a science fiction real-time strategy (RTS) game set in the violent, post-apocalyptic universe of the 41st Millennium. Utilizing the exceptional game design skills of Relic Entertainment, Dawn of War provides an immersive entertainment experience of epic proportions. Command hardened troops, deadly vehicles and high tech weaponry with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of the opposition. Whether you lead Humanity's finest - the Space Marines, the diabolic and villainous traitors of man - the Chaos Space Marines, the brutal and savage beasts - the Orks, or the psychic and technologically advanced alien warriors - the Eldar, you control the action and the fate of your race!

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is the first game in a long, long time that has even come close to doing the franchise justice. The fact that it hits the nail on the head isn't necessarily surprising; it's just been such a long wait that it's almost emotional. Everything from the drab and blasted landscapes to the perfectly realized models and varied animations make a perfect host for this ultra-violent future to inhabit.
Nothing about the gameplay will really surprise anyone (though the addition of reinforceable squads is pretty neat) but it doesn't particularly matter. The factions are balanced very well, the battles are entertaining enough to make excitable gamers pee their pants, and the pace keeps players attention stuck to the screen at all times. Relic kicked ass creating a great piece of entertainment. -IGN
