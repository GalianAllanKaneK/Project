Yostar and Hypergryph’s mobile tower-defense game, Arknights, remains the only gacha game I can confidently recommend to people — and trust me, I play a lot of them.

Arknights is mostly a single-player puzzle game, each level of the game has at least one set solution to beat it. The characters that you can roll for in the gacha system are the units you place down to beat the incoming swarm of bad guys. Each character has a unique set of abilities and are divided into classes, like medics or snipers. The thing about Arknights that makes it so nice is that each level can be completed using the low-rarity units. You don’t need that shiny, new, super-rare six-star unit to clear it.

There is something ridiculously satisfying about being stumped on a hard level, not knowing how to beat a new boss or get past a certain wave of enemies, and then figuring it out. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t see new levels or events often, but that downtime can be used to take a break from the game or farm materials to power up your characters. - polygon

As an avid player of Arknights, i can confidently say that this game is must play for those looking for a game that can challenge their planning and strategy. And being casual enough for people to not get burnout. Events are rare and updates are slow, but that actually does the game a favor. Becuase all that downtime can be spent either farming materials, which is incredibly simple, or improving and understanding your units for your plans. Now, in my opinion. The story of arknights is decent and the plost is interesting. But what really got my interest was the interactions of the characters with the world and each other, their thought, perspectives and ideals. All painting a picture of how they see their world, and how i as the player can interpret it as well.

Now while this game is free to play, its a gacha game. Most of the developers income comes from the purchase of premium packs or originium, the games premium currency. But worry not, you dont need to pay for a single cent with how f2p friendly this game is. And most of the time, the money is spent on character skins. So please, give the game a try, you wont regret it.
