Honkai Impact 3rd is a next-gen 3D cel-shaded anime action game. Experience epic stories and intense battles with Valkyries!
Honkai is the shadow of civilization that aims to exterminate it. The Will of Honkai grew with civilization until it wished to inhibit its progress, and thus created Herrschers, humanoid beings that possess unthinkable strength. To resist Honkai and save our home, you will assume the role of a Captain who commands a memorable cast of Valkyries. The bonds you forge will become your greatest weapon against Honkai! - Steam

Despite the questionable microtransactions, hard-to-earn gacha pulls that are tougher than FGO, Honkai Impact 3 manages to surpass even major triple-A games. That’s all because of its high-budget presentation, all-star cast, creative gameplay, and a right balance between fan service and a decent story.

It remains as one of my best gacha games even after three years of playing. It will take a lot for another publisher/developer to create an as vivid game. Active as Honkai Impact 3. miHoYo even uploads anime short films in their channel which are much better than Berserk’sBerserk’s animation.

The best part about the game is that it never feels like a pay-to-win game since you can earn so many premium items by just investing your time in it. You can even score better than whales in the co-op PvE too. Trust me, I’ve played enough hours with the game to distinguish if it feels unfair for F2Players or if it feels perfectly balanced as all things should be.
There is no other gacha game like this. -Games.lol

<br>
Its a free to play game than can be played on mobile, PC and console. So feel free to play the game.
